            Specifically, this target seeks to substantially reduce marine
            pollution from various sources, especially from land-based
            activities (UN General Assembly 2015). It’s aimed at reducing marine
            debris and nutrient pollution that causes harmful algal blooms and
            dead zones. This goal is centered on enhancing waste management,
            reducing plastic use and preventing agricultural runoff through
            legislation.

            This target highlights the need to sustainably manage and protect
            marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts.
            This includes enhancing the resilience of these ecosystems and
            advancing their restoration towards healthy and productive oceans.
            Strategies include creating marine protected areas, restoring
            habitats such as coral reefs and mangroves, and adopting sustainable
            fishing practices.

          <p>
            Targeted at mitigating the effects of the increased carbon dioxide
            uptake of the oceans, the objective is to reduce and prevent ocean
            acidification. Ocean acidification endangers life in the oceans,
            harms the food web, and threatens crucial services offered by the
            ocean and our food supply. Such mitigation strategies encompass
            reducing carbon emissions and increasing scientific study to track
            and comprehend acidification mechanisms.

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Rising Atmospheric CO₂ Levels</strong>: Increased carbon
              dioxide emissions from human activities lead to higher CO₂
              concentrations in the atmosphere, which dissolves into oceans,
              forming carbonic acid and lowering pH levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Threats to Marine Life</strong>: Ocean acidification
              adversely affects marine organisms, especially those with calcium
              carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals, mollusks, and some
              plankton species.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Impact on Coral Reefs</strong>: Lower pH levels hinder
              coral growth and structural integrity, leading to weakened reef
              ecosystems that support diverse marine life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitoring and Research Initiatives</strong>: Global
              efforts, like the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network
              (GOA-ON), aim to enhance scientific understanding and monitoring
              of ocean acidification to inform mitigation and adaptation
              strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Policy and International Cooperation</strong>: Sustainable
              Development Goal 14.3 emphasizes the need to minimize and address
              the impacts of ocean acidification through enhanced scientific
              cooperation at all levels.
